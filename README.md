# GyMG

Landing page made for a treasury consignee that needed presense in the web.
I did it with a bit of HTML, CSS (and bootstrap) & JS (with scrollreveal from animations)

## Demo

[Github deploy](https://jpkitro.github.io/GyMG-Definitive-page/) not the real version
and [Deployed with "Donweb"](http://gymg.com.ar/) is the version that the client have decided
